Notebook for music made with Strudel REPL using Obsidian

I do not know how to play any instrument but I want to make some music, Strudel REPL is a very nice tool to start with so here we are.

Problems (i.e. opportunities to learn)
- Strudel REPL does not allow to work on a local file
- To learn how to make music it is necessary to have something like a notebook to take notes on and study

Solution
- Create a docker container
- Install Obsidian
- Use this Obsidian plugin https://github.com/dudaanton/obsidian-strudel-plugin to arrange music into notes files
